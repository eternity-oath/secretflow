# Introduction
This folder contains examples of SecretFlow, a distributed machine learning technique that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a shared model while keeping their data private. SecretFlow is a comprehensive framework for preserving privacy, providing access to a range of technologies including Federated Learning, Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Trusted Execution Environment(TEE), Homomorphic Encryption(HE) and Differential Privacy (DP).

The examples in this repository are designed to demonstrate the basic concepts of SecretFlow and to provide a starting point for developers who want to implement SecretFlow applicaitons in their own projects.

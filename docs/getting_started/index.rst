Getting started
===============

Welcome to SecretFlow!

Please follow the :ref:`getting_started/deployment:deployment` and :ref:`getting_started/installation:installation` documentation to get SecretFlow ready.

Then, we encourage you to check :ref:`tutorial` to play with SecretFlow.

After that, please check :ref:`user_guide` which are first-party algorithms, tools and utilities to facilitate your development.

If you would like to integrate SecretFlow algorithms to your privacy-preserving systems with a unified interface, we encourage you to check :ref:`component`.

Finally, please refer to :ref:`developer` and :ref:`api` when you write you own SecretFlow programs.

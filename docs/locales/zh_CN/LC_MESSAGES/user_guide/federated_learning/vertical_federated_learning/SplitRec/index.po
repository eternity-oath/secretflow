"In traditional recommendation scenarios, user data is typically uploaded "
"to a central server for model training. However, cross-domain "
"recommendation refers to the distributed training of recommendation "
"models with data from different domains. For example, a user watches many"
" short videos on one platform and is recommended relevant ads on another "
"e-commerce platform. The e-commerce platform not only wants to utilize "
"its own data but also mining relevant information from the data on the "
"short video platform. Additionally, due to data security concerns, the "
"data from various platforms cannot be uploaded to a central server for "
"centralized machine learning training. This scenario of training models "
"with distributed data across different domains is well suited for split "
"learning in federated learning."
msgstr "在传统推荐场景中，用户的数据通常需要上传到中央服务器进行模型训练。而跨域推荐场景是指联合分布在不同域的数据进行分布式训练的推荐场景。例如一个用户在一个短视频平台看了很多短视频，在另一个电商平台被推荐相关的广告，电商平台除了自有数据外，也希望从短视频平台的数据中挖掘相关的信息。同时出于数据安全考虑，各平台数据不能被上传到中央服务器进行集中式的机器学习训练，这种联合分布在不同域的数据进行模型训练的场景很适合用联邦学习中的拆分学习。"

"In SplitRec, we provide the foundational framework for Split Learning: "
"each party owns a portion of the model structure, and the models from all"
" parties are combined to form a complete model. During the training "
"process, different parties perform local forward or backward propagation "
"calculations on their respective models and pass the computed results to "
"the next party. Multiple parties train the joint model until convergence."

"我们在隐语中提供了拆分学习的基础框架：每一个参与方拥有模型结构的一部分，所有参与方的模型合在一起形成一个完整的模型。训练过程中，不同参与方只对本地模型进行正向或者反向传播计算，并将计算结果传递给下一个参与方。多个参与方通过联合模型进行训练直至最终收敛。详情请查看"

"Another typical case of split learning is in bank marketing. Marketing is"
" the comprehensive operation and sales activity of the banking industry "
"to meet customer needs and achieve business goals in a constantly "
"changing market environment. Different banks and institutions may possess"
" different user features of the same customers. Banks would like to "
"leverage user features from other institutions to provide more "
"information for marketing models. We provide an demo in "
":doc:`/tutorial/Split_Learning_for_bank_marketing` on using our split "
"learning framework to train a bank marketing model."

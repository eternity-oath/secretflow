"The federated learning here refers specifically to the federated learning"
" of horizontal scenarios. This mode applies to the situation where each "
"participant has the same business but different customer groups are "
"reached. In this case, samples from various parties can be combined to "
"train a joint model with better performance. For example, in the medical "
"scene, each hospital has its own unique patient group, and hospitals in "
"different regions almost do not overlap each other, but their examination"
" records for medical records (such as images, blood tests, etc.) are of "
"the same type."
msgstr "水平联邦模式适用于参与方业务相同但是客户群体不同的场景。该场景下，可以将来自各方的样本联合训练得到一个相比单方训练表现更好的模型。例如在医疗场景中，每个医院都有自己的患者群体，而不同地区的医院患者大部分是不重合的，但是患者的医疗数据（比如影像、验血结果等），其数据形式可能是相同的。"
